# Future Development

## Scoring Engine Rules
The following new rules for the Scoring Engine are under consideration:
* Minimum Imaging Time: assign a higher priority to those targets that have less imaging time available.  For example, if you have a target that only rises high enough for a short time each year, it would score higher since it would have less availability.  (Overlaps with existing Setting Soonest rule).

## General/Other
* Support for planning based on weather station data like (e.g. sky quality).
* Support target types other than DSOs - comets for example.
* Ability to load targets in real time from [NASA's GCN](https://gcn.nasa.gov/) or similar alert networks and then interrupt imaging to switch to a high priority target.
