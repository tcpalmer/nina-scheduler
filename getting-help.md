# Getting Help

{: .note }
Before you ask for help, please be sure you have met the [prerequisites](getting-started.html#prerequisites) and made an effort to understand the [concepts](concepts/index.html) and learn the plugin.  Please also check for [known issues](release.html#known-issues).

Ask for help (tag @tcpalmer) in the #target-scheduler channel on the NINA project [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rWRbVbw).

You might be asked for the following:
* A detailed description of the problem and the context in which it occurred.
* The sequence file for the Advanced Sequencer run.
* The Target Scheduler plugin log file from the session (in %localappdata%\NINA\SchedulerPlugin\Logs\).  You might be asked to duplicate your problem with the log level set to 'Debug' or even 'Trace' ([in Profile Preferences](target-management/profiles.html#general-preferences)).
* The NINA log file from the session (in %localappdata%\NINA\Logs\).  You might be asked to duplicate your problem with NINA log level set to 'Debug' (in NINA Options > General > Advanced Settings).
* Your Scheduler plugin database file (%localappdata%\NINA\SchedulerPlugin\schedulerdb.sqlite).
* Your location (lat/long) for the profile.  For privacy, you can alter the least significant digits.
* Your Custom Horizon (if applicable).
* Depending on the problem, details about the NINA profile and equipment used.
