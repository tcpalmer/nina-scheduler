# Planning Engine

The following sections describe the scheduling/planning approach used by the plugin.

## Dispatch Scheduling

Target Scheduler is a _dispatch scheduler_ [^1], meaning it generates a plan on demand covering the 'next' step only.  This is in contrast to a _static_ or _global_ scheduler that would generate a plan for the entire night.  Although it might seem like a static plan is a better approach, dispatch scheduling has several advantages in the context of automated imaging:
* If you generate a plan for the whole night, it's almost immediately out of sync with reality due to other operations that may take place: slew/center, autofocus, meridian flip, center after drift, dither settle, etc.  Some of these can be predicted and estimated - but not all and not consistently.
* A dispatch scheduler can take new information into account.  For example, images may or may not be deemed acceptable by the [image grader](../post-acquisition/image-grader.html), which changes the number of images remaining for a target, which impacts the next plan.
* You can make changes to the project/target database that will be used during the very next planning cycle.
* Dispatch scheduling is a better match for the NINA Advanced Sequencer and its approach to automation and triggers/interrupts.
* In the future, the plugin will support constraints based on weather metrics such as sky quality or humidity which can obviously change over the course of a night.

## Operation

The Planning Engine executes a series of steps to pick the best target to image at the moment and then schedule the applicable exposures for that target.  It operates in phases and in the end, produces a _Target Plan_.

A Target Plan is either:
* A delay to tell the Target Scheduler instruction it needs to simply wait for target availability.  At the end of the delay, it will call the planner again.
* The selected target, instructions to run, the start time, and stop time.

The stop time is the end of the [planning window](#plan-window) and is used to interrupt the plan in case that time is exceeded.

The above timeline shows a sequence of six plans generated for the Target Scheduler.  Adding optional instructions for the Before/After Wait and Before/After New Target events is discussed in [Custom Event Instructions](../sequencer/index.html#custom-event-instructions).  Detailed sequence of events:

#### Plan 1
The planner is called and Target 1 is returned.  Execute:
* Slew and center on Target 1
* Optional instructions for 'Before New Target'
* Take planned exposures
* Optional instructions for 'After Each Target'

#### Plan 2
The planner is called and Target 1 is again returned.  Since the target didn't change, both slew/center and 'Before New Target' are skipped.  Execute:
* Take planned exposures
* Optional instructions for 'After New Target' (since we will subsequently determine that a Wait is next)
* Optional instructions for 'After Each Target'

#### Plan 3
The planner is called and a Wait is returned.  Execute:
* Optional instructions for 'Before Wait'
* Wait ...
* Optional instructions for 'After Wait'

#### Plan 4
The planner is called and Target 2 is returned.  Execute:
* Slew and center on Target 2
* Optional instructions for 'Before New Target'
* Take planned exposures
* Optional instructions for 'After New Target' (since we will subsequently determine that the next target has changed)
* Optional instructions for 'After Each Target'

#### Plan 5
The planner is called and Target 3 is returned.  Execute:
* Slew and center on Target 3
* Optional instructions for 'Before New Target'
* Take planned exposures

A safety interrupt (handled outside of Target Scheduler) occurs some time during the execution of Plan 5.  Any optional 'After New Target' and 'After Each Target' instructions are skipped due to the interrupt.  When the safety issue has cleared, the Target Scheduler instruction will be reset to simply call the planner again.

#### Plan 6
The planner is called and Target 3 is returned.  Execute:
* Slew and center on Target 3
* Optional instructions for 'Before New Target'
* Take planned exposures
* Optional instructions for 'After New Target'
* Optional instructions for 'After Each Target'

At this point, no more targets remain for the night so the Target Scheduler instruction ends and passes control to the next item in the sequence.

The following sections detail the different phases of planner operation.

## Select Candidate Projects/Targets
* Retrieve the list of active projects for the current NINA profile from the database. 
* Reject those that can never rise at this latitude.
* Reject those that are already complete.

## Determine Target Visibility
Begin by finding the nighttime circumstances for the upcoming night (start/stop times for each level of twilight).

### For Each Target

1. Find the most inclusive level of twilight acceptable over all target exposure plans.  For example, if you have an exposure plan for Ha that is acceptable during astronomical twilight plus another for Lum that can only image at true nighttime, then the overall potential timespan is astronomical twilight start to astronomical twilight end.  This is the **_twilight time span_** for the target.

2. Based on date, location, and horizon settings, determine the target circumstance times: rise above horizon, transit, and set below horizon.  The rise/set times define the **_visibility time span_** for the target.  

3. Find the overlap of the twilight time span and the visibility time span.  This is the **_potential imaging time span_**.  If this time span is empty, reject the target.

4. If the project defines a meridian window, then clip the potential imaging time span to that window.  If there is no overlap after clipping, reject the target.  This is the **_imaging time span_** for the target.

5. If the current time is not inside the imaging time span, then we reject the target _but_ mark it as potentially acceptable at a later time.

6. If the time between now and the end of the imaging time span is less than the minimum imaging time set on the project, then reject the target.

Otherwise, the target can be imaged now and is accepted.  The list of all such targets is the **_refined candidate list_**.

## Moon Avoidance

For each target in the refined candidate list:

1. For each exposure plan/template, if it enables moon avoidance then calculate the angular separation between the target and the moon.  Apply the avoidance formula and reject those exposure plans that violate it.
2. If all exposure plans for a target were rejected, then reject the target.

## Nothing Available Now?

If all targets were rejected, then find all of those that would be available later in the night.  Of those, find the one with the earliest start time.  At this point, the plan is returned to the Target Scheduler instruction with a Target Plan directing it to wait until that time.

## Nothing Available At All?

If all targets were rejected and none will be available later, then return null to the Target Scheduler instruction.  This will end execution of the instruction and the sequence will just fall through to the next instruction.  The [Target Scheduler Condition](../sequencer/condition.html) using the 'While Targets Remain Tonight' mode can be used to check for this state in outer containers in your sequence.

## Scoring Engine

If only a single candidate target remains, then it is the selected target.  Otherwise, run the _Scoring Engine_ (described below) to produce a winning target.

## Plan Window

A time span is determined for planning the sequence instructions for the selected target.  The span begins immediately and ends at a selected stop time.  The stop time is important because it helps to control when the current plan ends and therefore when the planning engine is called again.  Since circumstances may have changed at that point (e.g. a higher priority target is now visible), it is desirable to run the engine again and let it decide what is now best to image.  The cost of running the engine again is low since it runs quickly and if the same target as the previous is selected, the instruction will skip the slew/center operation.

There are two methods of determining the stop time, controlled by the [Smart Plan Window](../target-management/profiles.html#general-preferences) profile preference.

### Smart Stop Time

If the Smart Plan Window preference is enabled, then the stop time will be determined as follows:
* If the target has a meridian window, then the stop time is the end of that window.
* If there are no other potential future targets, then the stop time is the hard stop time (end of visibility or twilight) for the target.
* Otherwise, the set of other potential targets is examined:
  * If any of those could have been selected now but weren't (e.g. lower score) and they could potentially be selected next, then the stop time is just the start time plus the minimum.  This gives those other targets a shot at being selected next as circumstances change.
  * Otherwise, if any other targets could start after the minimum window, then the stop time will be the start time of the earliest of those targets.

In many cases, this approach will result in longer windows and a greater chance that the desired cadence of exposures and dithers will run as opposed to being unnaturally chopped up by the minimum time.

However, if you have many targets that can be imaged at any given time, then the behavior will be closer to the legacy method and you may not notice much difference.

### Legacy Stop Time
If the Smart Plan Window preference is disabled, then the legacy method is used:
* If the target has a meridian window, then the stop time is the end of that window.
* Otherwise, it is simply the start time plus the minimum imaging time set for the project.

## Generate Sequence Instructions

For all exposure plans for the selected target that weren't rejected for moon avoidance or aren't appropriate for the twilight level, generate the set of sequence instructions to take those exposures.

The ordering of exposures is driven by the [Filter Switch Frequency](../target-management/projects.html#filter-switch-frequency) setting for the associated project.

The set of exposures is selected (based on exposure times) to fit within the plan window.  However, when Target Plans execute, they will almost always run longer than the plan window end time due to the execution of time-intensive triggers such as Meridian Flip, Center After Drift, or Autofocus.  In general, this is acceptable and of course the execution would be interrupted by the plan hard stop time if it runs past that.

If [dithering](../target-management/projects.html#dithering) is enabled for the project, then the sequence of planned exposures is analyzed and dither instructions are inserted at appropriate points.

At this point, the target, instructions, and start/hard stop time are added to the Target Plan and returned to the Target Scheduler instruction for execution.

## Scoring Engine

The Scheduler uses a Scoring Engine to select a target when multiple candidates are under consideration.  The engine executes a set of rules on each target to produce a score, with the highest score winning.  The applicable Project has a set of configurable weights that are used to modulate the application of each rule.

### Scoring Rules

The following rules are currently implemented:

|Rule Name|Default Weight|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Meridian Window Priority|75%|A target scores higher if the project it is associated with is using a Meridian Window to limit imaging time.  The rationale is to prefer targets using meridian windows since those windows are limited over the course of any imaging session.|
|Mosaic Completion|0%|If the project for the target is marked as a Mosaic project, then the target will score higher the lower its completion rate is to the average completion rate of the other targets in that project.  The rationale is to balance exposures across the panels.|
|Percent Complete|50%|A target scores higher based on its ratio of accepted to desired images over all exposure plans.  The rationale is to prefer completion of a project over starting acquisition of something new.|
|Project Priority|50%|A project can set priority to High, Normal, or Low.  Targets for that project will score higher or lower depending on the setting.|
|Setting Soonest|50%|A target scores higher based on how close it is to setting below either the minimum altitude or (if enabled) the custom horizon.  The rationale is to prefer targets that will set before others, implying less time remaining in the target's imaging season.|
|Target Switch Penalty|67%|A target scores higher if it is the same target as the one immediately preceding this run.  The rationale is that switching targets is expensive given the required slew/center time.|

A user can select different weights for each rule to achieve different goals.  Setting a weight to zero disables that rule entirely.

Note that the default weights for Meridian Window Priority and Target Switch Penalty are set higher than the others.  Missing a meridian window is a high opportunity cost since those windows are relatively 'scarce' during any session.  Switching targets is expensive given the slew/center time.

If you use Scheduler Preview, you can click the [View Details](../scheduler-preview.html#view-details) button to see a log of the planning details which includes the calculations for each scoring rule for each target.  The same information will be written to the [Target Scheduler log](../technical-details.html#logging) for actual planning runs from sequence execution.

### Rule Interactions and Conflicts

The scoring engine is designed to be easily extended by adding additional rules.  However, there is a limit with approaches like this.  As the number of rules increases, the predictability of engine outcomes goes down - and predictability can be desirable.  As the number grows it might be appropriate for users to select a subset that work well and disable the others.  Several additional rules are under consideration - see the [roadmap](../roadmap.html#scoring-engine-rules).

In particular, the Percent Complete and Mosaic Completion rules may not interact well.  If your goal is to use Mosaic Completion to balance exposures across mosaic panels, then you probably want to set the weight for Mosaic Completion high and the Percent Complete and Target Switch Penalty weights to zero.
